This project demonstrates my profieciency in creating responsive web designs that maintain their appeal across different screen sizes.  It highlights my front-end development skills through the implemntation of five distinct modals: one for changing the profile picture, another for updating profile information, a third for adding a card, a fourth for viewing a card, and a confirmation modal for card deletion.  Additionally, this project features functional like and delete buttons.  I utilized object-oriented programming and integrated and API to manage all card information, ensuring dynamic and interactive user experiences.  In addition, every form within the project is equipped with comprehensive form validation, ensuring that user inputs are thoroughly checked and meet the required criteria before submission.
